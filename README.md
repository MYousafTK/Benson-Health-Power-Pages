# Project Task/Challenge: 
BensonHealthCare has a diverse client base and is looking to streamline the process of integrating its data files. The company aimed to centralize this data to enhance accessibility and security, ensuring that clients could view only their specific data through any Business Intelligence tool. This required the application of sophisticated data engineering techniques to refine and organize the raw data effectively.

# TripleK Solution: 
TripleK Tech, a leading IT service provider, has developed a tailored solution for BensonHealthCare using Azure Data Factory as the principal tool for data engineering. This solution involves extracting data from Power Pages, transforming it robustly, and then securely storing it in each client’s specific Data Lake. Finally, to ensure personalized data access, PowerBI reports are embedded and displayed uniquely to each client.
